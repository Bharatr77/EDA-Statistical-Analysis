# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. It includes data cleaning, handling missing values, detecting and treating outliers, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and generating insights through visualizations.

Features
- *Data Cleaning*: Handling missing values and inconsistent data.
- *Outlier Detection*: Using boxplots and statistical methods to identify and treat outliers.
- *Feature Scaling*: Applying StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler for normalization and standardization.
- *Encoding Categorical Variables*: Using One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding for machine learning compatibility.
- *Visualization*: Using Matplotlib, Seaborn for data distribution, correlation heatmaps, and pairplots.
- *Insights Generation*: Identifying patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

- Tools & Technologies
- Python: Core programming language for data analysis.
- Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization and plotting.
- Scikit-learn: Feature scaling and encoding techniques.

Challenges Faced
- Handling large missing value blocks and deciding imputation strategies.
- Detecting and treating outliers without losing important information.
- Choosing appropriate scaling and encoding methods for different features.
- Optimizing code for performance on high-dimensional datasets.

Insights Gained
- Understanding data distribution and identifying skewed features.
